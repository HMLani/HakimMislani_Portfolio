                    <h2>About Me</h2>

                    <p>Hello! My name's Muhammad Hakim Bin Mislani. I'm currently a year 2 student soon to be year 3 studying in Diploma in Information Technology which 
                        was formally known as Digital Design and Development at Republic Polytechnic. I have lots of creative ideas that want to bring to life whenever it
                        comes to designing. My passion is to become a UI/UX designer to create interfaces that's visually appealing, user-friendly and accessible for all users 
                        to use. My programming skills are only decent when it comes to make a web or mobile application look appealing as I have most of my ideas on developing 
                        applications looks visually appealing and user-friendly. The tools I've used to create my projects are Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, Figma, Unity, 
                        React and React Native, and Flutter. My hobbies are playing computer games whenever I have free time  to clear my mind off from stress and relax my mind.

                        <h3>Music Playlist with Player (Flutter)</h3>

                        <p>This project was my introduction to Flutter. When I learn about mobile development during my studies @ ITE using
                            Swift, I started to wonder if I may create an app on Android. During my resreach of how to create and learn one, 
                            I stumble upon Flutter, a software development kit that uses Dart programming language that developed by google 
                            and designed by Lars Bak and Kasper Lund released on the November 14, 2013. The other software development tool 
                            was React, but I've decided to go with Flutter as I was quite familiar with the workflow of it as it reminded me 
                            of what I did on Swift but without draging in the parts if the components (i.e. buttons, textboxes, navigation) 
                            into the design. <br><br>
                            
                            I started to reseached on how to create a Music app with Flutter as I had an idea to create a 
                            music app with an implemention of an API from Spotify to get the users music data into my customizable app, in 
                            short a fully funtional Spotify Clone where users are able to customize the interface. The idea that I've got was 
                            inspired by a community made 'extension' that let's users customize the desktop app called Spicetify. When I 
                            explored Spicetify, I was impressed by the sheer amount of community made themes and extensions to make the app 
                            more lively and appealing to users. <br><br>
                            
                            So, when I reseached that if there's any mobile version of Spicetify but there's none. On one hand I could make a 
                            mobile version of it but it would be a hassle to make it work on the mobile and I don't have the resources to make 
                            it work for both iOS and Android and that's how I've decided to make this project but without the API implemention 
                            as this project was only a learning experiences on how Flutter works. As of right now,I had to put the Flutter 
                            journey on hold or hiatus as I'm mostly focusing on my studies and trying to find myself a suitable part-time job 
                            to support myself.

                        <h3>'Back to present' Virtual Reality (VR) Escape Room</h3>

                        <p>
                            'Back to Present' is a Virtual Reality (VR) Escape Room game that I've made using Unity. The process of developing 
                            it challenging as I had to think of a theme and puzzles that not too simple or too difficult for players to solve 
                            when playing the game. The theme idea was that the player accidentally fell into a portal of thier future self and
                            to escape the lab while solving puzzles in each rooms. The puzzles in each rooms are unique and different from each 
                            other as I wanted each rooms to have a different feeling and experience rather than using the same puzzles mechanics
                            and dull gameplay throughout the game. Each rooms has a tablet of what to do so that the player knows how to proceed
                            out the room.<br><br>

                            <strong><u>Pluzzes featured in game</u></strong>
                                    <p>Room 1: Player has to place cubes on each sets of 3 'pressure plate' to leave and procceed to the next room.
                                            The 'pressure plate' has no animation when the cube is placed on it but there will be a sound indication
                                            when the cubes onto of the plates. The first set of cubes are place near the plates to let the player know 
                                            what to do but the other cubes are in the room when the player has to find them.<br></p>
                                
                                    <p>Room 2: Player has to key in the correct number combination to unlock the door. The number combination for the puzzle 
                                            is shown by the light pads near the number pad terminal. Each light pad is light up to the combination of terminal 
                                            and players had to press the correct number of the light position to proceed to the next room. For example, if the 
                                            lights position are 1, 4, 5, 9, the player has to press 1, 4, 5, 9 on the number terminal. There are 3 terminals with
                                            different combinations to be solved and a sound will be played when all terminals are entered correctly.<br></p>
                                
                                    <p>Room 3: Player has to enter a combination of the correct flashing light sequence on one of the 4 terminals in the middle of 
                                            the room. The clue is shown on the tablet and have to look at the number of flashes on the light where the tablet stated
                                            to open the door. If the player entered the number sequence of flashing lights on the wrong terminal, a sound will indicate
                                            that the player enter it in the wrong terminal but if the player enter it on the correct terminal, a sound will play and the 
                                            door will to let the player proceed to the next room.<br></p>
                               
                                    <p>Room 4: Player has to look around the room to find a colour tube to place on top of 'table' where the tube will automatically 
                                            placed. The tube must be placed on the correct 'pad' to open the door and if the player placed it on the wrong pad on the 
                                            'table', the light in front of the table will light up red with a sound it and vice versa. When all six tubes are placed 
                                            correctly, the door will open and the player will be able to escape the lab.</p>

                        <h3>Name Card Design</h3>

                        <p>
                            The proces to create this name card was quite a process as I have to think of several design concepts that look minimalistic and professional 
                            for each elemetns to be seen clearly for viewer to see. The choice of the color palette was chosen as to make it pop for better visibility and 
                            appealing if it's printed into a physical busniess card. The goal of why I chose the color was that I wanted to make the card feel calm and 
                            pleasing to the viwers eyes and not too flashy and cluttered with too much design elements as want to focused on clarity and readibility maintaining
                            a layout that is clean and organized. On the back of the card, I've decided to make it clean and simple with my logo positioned to the right slightly 
                            rather than to the center as I wanted to make it look apart from other standard card design that I've encountered during my research when designing ideas.<br><br>

                            The font used are 'ITC Avant Garde Gothic' for both my name and my designated job title for the viewer focus on when they either take a quick glance or skim 
                            through it with the font sizes of 10 to 11 points and font weight in bold and regular. As for my information details, I used 'Futara PT' as it's looks clean, 
                            modern and easy to read in font size of 10 points and font weight bold and light. The logo idea was created by using my first two letter of my first and last
                            name combined into each other. I've decided to make it look like a tattoo design as it look unique and different.
